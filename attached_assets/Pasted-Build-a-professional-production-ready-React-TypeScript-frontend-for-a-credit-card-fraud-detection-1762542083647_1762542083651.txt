9. UI/UX Requirements
Design System:

Modern, professional color scheme:

Primary: Blue (#3B82F6)
Success: Green (#10B981)
Warning: Yellow (#F59E0B)
Danger: Red (#EF4444)
Neutral: Gray shades



Components:

Reusable Card component with shadow and hover effects
Loading skeletons for data fetching
Toast notifications for success/error messages
Confirm dialogs for critical actions
Empty states with helpful illustrations
Error boundaries for error handling

Responsive Design:

Mobile-first approach
Breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)
Collapsible sidebar on mobile
Touch-friendly buttons (min 44x44px)

Accessibility:

ARIA labels on all interactive elements

11. State Management

Use React Context for:

Theme (light/dark mode)

Local component state for:

Form inputs
UI toggles
Modal visibility


Consider TanStack Query (React Query) for:

API data fetching
Caching
Automatic refetching



12. API Integration Setup
Create mock API structure (assuming backend endpoints):
typescript// Example API endpoints structure
/api/dashboard/stats
/api/transactions?page=1&limit=10&status=fraud
/api/detect (POST with transaction data)
/api/analytics/trends
/api/model/info
/api/history?from=date&to=date
```

- Include loading states
- Error handling with retry logic
- Success/error toast notifications
- Request timeout handling

#### 13. **Form Validation**

Use Zod schemas for:
- Transaction amount (positive number, max 6 digits)
- Card number (16 digits, Luhn algorithm validation)
- Date validations (not future dates)
- Required field validations
- Real-time validation feedback

#### 14. **Performance Optimizations**

- Lazy load routes with React.lazy()
- Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo
- Debounce search inputs (300ms)
- Virtual scrolling for large tables (react-window)
- Image optimization
- Code splitting by route

#### 15. **Additional Features**

**Nice-to-haves for extra credit:**
- Dark mode implementation
- Export reports to PDF
- Real-time WebSocket updates simulation
- Animated transitions between pages
- Comparison mode (compare two transactions)
- Saved filters/preferences
- Print-friendly views

#### 16. **Data Mocking**

Since this is a college project, create:
- Mock transaction data (100+ samples)
- Faker.js or similar for realistic data
- Mock API responses with realistic delays
- Seeded random data for consistency

#### 17. **Code Quality Standards**

- Functional components with hooks only
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- TypeScript interfaces for all props
- ESLint + Prettier configuration
- Component folder structure:
```
  /components
    /ui (reusable components)
    /features (feature-specific)
    /layouts
  /pages
  /hooks
  /utils
  /types
  /services (API calls)
  /constants
18. Documentation Requirements
Include inline comments for:

Complex algorithms
API integration points
Custom hooks logic
Utility functions

19. Testing Considerations
Prepare structure for:

Component testing setup
Form validation testing
Mock data generators

20. Demo Data Scenarios
Create sample scenarios:

High-risk fraud transaction
Low-risk legitimate transaction
Borderline case (50% confidence)
Batch of mixed transactions


Design Inspiration
Look similar to modern fintech dashboards like:

Stripe Dashboard
Plaid Dashboard
Datadog monitoring
Professional, clean, data-focused
